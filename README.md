# ibmz-accelerated-for-pytorch
PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. Itâ€™s one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research and Language processing as it uses dynamic computation graphs and is completely Pythonic. On IBM z16 and later (running Linux on IBM Z or IBM z/OS Container Extensions (IBM zCX)), PyTorch will leverage new inference acceleration capabilities that transparently target the IBM Integrated Accelerator and provide significant acceleration to traditional ML and DL as well as Encoder LLM AI models.
